# Friendship-Graph

Computer Science 130A Final Project - A Social Network * ~~~ Radhika Khatod and Drew Taylor ~~~
Introduction:

The purpose of this program is to create a simple social network using C++.

Infrastructure:

The Friendship Graph is built from the FriendArray, Node, and FriendNode files. The FriendArray is the Friendship Graph object. The FriendArray contains an array of Nodes. Each Node contains a string for the name, an int for the age, and a string for the occupation. Each Node also contains a pointer to a FriendNode, which is just a string for a name and a pointer to another FriendNode. This is tentative because the Node could just contain a Profile object instead.
